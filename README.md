### Founded By: Sam'an Griffiths

Description
We are a simple and easy way to find a new family member. We utilize the kaggle animal shelter database to give you a list of animal shelters near you where you might find the newest addition to your family! Each year, approximately 920,000 shelter animals are euthanized. With your help, we can put a dent in that number.
